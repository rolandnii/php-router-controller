# php-router-controller
This is a mini project to try and understand how routers work in `laravel`.   

- [App]()   
  The App folder contains the `Router` and `Controller`.

- [View]()  
  The View Folder contains the page templates, in other words `html`, `css` ,`js` and  `php`;  
- [.htaccess]()   
  The htaccess file is used to change the behaviour of the request  to make in the sense that in every request the web.php file is executed.

- [web.php]()  
  The web.php file contains all the routes
